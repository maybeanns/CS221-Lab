# CS221-Lab

This repository contains a collection of lab tasks and exercises related to data structures and algorithms. The tasks are implemented in C++ and cover various fundamental topics.

## Table of Contents

1. [Lab 1: Linked List]
2. [Lab 2: Doubly Linked List]
3. [Lab 3: Circular Linked List]
4. [Lab 4: Stack]
5. [Lab 5: Queue]
6. [Lab 6: Sorting Algos]

## Lab 1: Linked List

In this lab, we explore the basic concepts of a singly linked list. You will find an implementation of a singly linked list along with various functions for insertion, deletion, and display.

## Lab 2: Doubly Linked List

Lab 2 introduces the concept of a doubly linked list. You'll find an implementation that includes the insertion of elements at the end of the list, display functionality, and the ability to delete elements based on their values.

## Lab 3: Circular Linked List

This lab dives into circular linked lists. You can explore the implementation of a circular linked list, including insertion, deletion, and display functions. Circular linked lists have no distinct end, making them an interesting data structure to work with.

## Lab 4: Stack

Lab 4 is dedicated to the stack data structure. You'll find a stack implementation along with typical stack operations such as push, pop, and display.

## Lab 5: Queue

## Lab 4: Sorting Algos

## Usage

Each lab folder contains a C++ implementation of the respective data structure and associated operations. You can compile and run the code using a C++ compiler, such as g++, on your local machine.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have improvements, bug fixes, or new features related to the lab tasks, please feel free to create a pull request. Be sure to follow our [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
